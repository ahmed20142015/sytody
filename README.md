flutter run
```

## How it works

**TL;DR** The flutter app open a channel on the host platform. It uses it :
 
 - to ask for speech recognition and microphone usage. The permission is asked on the first application launch 
 - to start, cancel and stop the speech recognition 
 - to listen to the recognition result

- [3. Flutter plugins](https://hackernoon.com/flutter-native-apis-and-plugins-3-3-b84776fc8a7e)
 
### Recognition

- iOS : [Speech API](https://developer.apple.com/reference/speech) : 4 languages are enabled in Sytody : FR / EN / RU / IT
- Android : [SpeechRecognizer](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/SpeechRecognizer.html) : recognition should work with the device default locale, but some others may needs to be installed to enable other languages.

### UI

A [ListView](https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/widgets/ListView-class.html) with [TaskWidget](https://github.com/rxlabz/sytody/blob/master/lib/task.dart) items
